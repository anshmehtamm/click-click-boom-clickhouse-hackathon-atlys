"""Lean, size-capped ClickHouse tools — built to replace the official mcp-clickhouse
server's list_tables/run_query as the agents' default, after measuring that a single
list_tables(database='atlys') call returns ~62,000 chars (~15,500 tokens): full
column metadata (types, comments, codecs) for every table in one response. In a
multi-turn tool-calling loop, every subsequent turn resends the whole growing
conversation, so one oversized call compounds across every later turn in the same
agent invocation — this is what actually drove real runs to ~90-100K input tokens
for a SINGLE agent call (measured via LibreChat's own transaction ledger in Mongo).

Two things fix this:
1. Tools here are narrow and compact by construction (list_tables returns just
   name/engine/row count; describe_table returns columns for ONE table, name+type
   only — no comments/codecs/stats bloat).
2. Anything still large gets offloaded: run_query writes the full result to a
   scratch file and returns a small preview + pointer, with grep_scratch/read_scratch
   tools to inspect the rest without ever pulling it all into context at once.
